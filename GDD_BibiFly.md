# Bibi Fly

## Introduction
### Game Summary
Towa-sama gets mistakenly identified as an angel again and got sent to heaven. You (Bibi) must now rescue and bring her back to the human realm

### Inspiration
Arcade games of jumping up clouds indefinitely

### Player Experience
An infinitely "ascending" game where the the player only loses when falling to the bottom. The higher they go, the higher the score.

### Platform
Game will be released on chromium browser. If couldn't figure out how then Windows, Linux, and Android

### Development Software
Game Engine to use is Godot3
Art and UI will be in pixel art, via aseprite. (If I can't draw then ask someone else)
Music and SFX will use free assets (Or if someone has an 8bit/chiptune cover of her songs, request)

### Genre
Single Player, Arcade, Casual

### Target Audience	
Fans and people looking for time-killers or casual games


## Concept	
### Gameplay overview
The player controls a single character as clouds infinitely spawn above them. Clouds disappear as soon as they leave your vision and hitting the bottom results in a game over. Scores are increased as you ascend and pick up collectibles. However, the higher you go, the more hindrances and difficulties can appear.

### Theme Interpretation (Probably none. Patience?)	
### Primary Mechanics
Movement. Simply moving from left to right to control the character as they ascend and descend from the clouds while also being able to speed up that process
### Secondary Mechanics	
Power-ups. Can speed up your progress potentially making it riskier, save you from falling, and even disrupt enemies
## Art	
### Theme Interpretation	
### Design	
The game will have pixel art as its style and will use color palettes of other holomem wherever possible

## Audio	
### Music
As it is a fan game, I hope to use one of her songs (if fitting) as an instrumental with the style of 8bit/chiptune

### Sound Effects
Most probably free assets. Especially for jumps, pickups, and any other suitable places

## Game Experience	
### UI
In-game will only display score, pause button, and power-up icon

### Controls
Keyboard Arrow Keys
Accelerometer for android and tap
